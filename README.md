# Elements Node Python RPC Tools

This repository contains a collection of simple Python tools for interacting with an Elements node using RPC credentials. These scripts allow you to perform various tasks such as checking balances, sending assets, creating wallets, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before using these scripts, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- The `python-bitcoinrpc` library for RPC communication.

You can install the required library using pip:

```bash
pip install python-bitcoinrpc
```

## Usage

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://happytavern.co/oceanslim/elements.py.git
cd elements.py
```

## Setup

If you are on Windows and you're unsure if you have pyhton or not, run the exe located in this repository. This will run you though the setup. Alternatively, running `python setup.py` will run the same program for setting up your enviornment and rpc config json.
